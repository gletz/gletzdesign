===========

I began my career as a graphic designer in the 1980s, when most computers were giant mainframes instead of phones and tablets. After a brief period doing traditional print design in Dallas and New Mexico, I found my way to San Francisco just as design and computers were about to converge. I was in the right place at the right time.

In 1995, I returned to Seattle to accept a job offer from Microsoft, where I worked for seven years, most of them as a product designer in the Office group. 

After Microsoft I needed time to regroup. So I checked out for a while. I bought a small business and ran it for seven years, until I sold it in 2010. 

Now I'm excited to return to design. It feels like I'm in the right place at the right time again. 

[21 Projects](http://www.gletzdesign.com/) was about bringing a lot of old work back to life and making a webpage to display it. I hoped the webpage itself might be sufficient new work to get my foot back in the door, but it hasn't worked yet. I realize there needs to be more. 

A challenge in working on imaginary projects for a portfolio is taking yourself too seriously. It needs to feel like a sketching process rather than a product rollout. It should be iterative so the work can be refined while it is displayed. Otherwise it falls into danger of never being displayed. To that end I want to explore a process to use GitHub for the development of design work instead of, or along with, code.

I've recently become more excited about writing code than I've ever been. I'm not sure how much of a developer I'll ever become, but I'm currently trying to learn as much JavaScript as I can (as well, of course, as HTML and CSS). I've been attending local JavaScript meet-ups, and that exposed me to GitHub. As a designer, the use of a version control system is not native to my craft. So, at first, the concept of how I could apply GitHub to my needs was elusive for me, but I had a sense it would be important to figure out.

Even as a non-developer I soon became intrigued with GitHub for both its private and public projects. 

I have a project I've worked on that evolved into more than a portfolio piece, and is now an idea for a start-up. I've been stymied on it since it got to that point because I won't be able to develop it much further by myself. I've also been puzzling over how to present it securely to potential partners with the necessary licensing and IP protection, as well as a process to facilitate team-building and collaboration. After a little research, it seems GitHub may be the perfect place for that sort of thing. 

Starting that private project might be getting ahead of myself though. First I need to find a place and a process for creating and displaying new work. I realize GitHub is intended for developers to share code projects, but it seems that it should work well for sharing design projects also. As a designer who does some coding and wants to do more, it just feels comfortable (so far). Actually making it work will be an ongoing project, but GitHub feels right for that, too.

So I plan to put up a lot of work in a lot of projects and let it speak for itself. Maybe I've finally met my muse. Or maybe I should say met my medium. And maybe McLuhan should have said the medium is the muse, not the message.
